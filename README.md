This project will help me comprehensively practice and apply my coding knowledge, with particular emphasis on optimally utilizing HTML and CSS. More languages may be practiced and used in the future, as I learn the best tools for different tasks, designs, and problems. The first assignment will be a landing page. The project will be set up as a book review blog, to organically utilize my own content and interest.
