            <h3><em><strong>3.5 stars</em></strong></h3>
            <h4>A "Goose Girl" retelling with a Middle Eastern backdrop</h4>
            <p>I really enjoyed FMC (Thorn)'s struggle between the simple 
                life she yearned for and the royal one she was born into. The 
                author proved that she had a way with words and understanding 
                people. I wished for <strong>more</strong> time, actually, 
                seeing the friendship between Thorn, Violet, and Sage rather 
                than just being told of it, but enjoyed the friendship with 
                Falada. I also <em>really</em> wanted to see more of the romance as the 
                story neared the end.</p>
