        <h4>A beautiful and lyrical ode to the natural world of the Carolina marshes.</h4>
        <p>I loved Kya's gentle, though broken, nature. I felt for her as she was repeatedly abandoned, adn saw myself in her inward retreat, realizing she could trust only what she could depend on: herself and her marsh. Or at least, that's her worldview and learned belief set. Ultimately, I was unsure of the author's intended message. In some ways, it seems she is trying to subvert the noble savage theme <em>by</em> playing into the disgusting savage theme. And although the lyrical descriptions of the natural world were beautiful, otherwise the writing (and particularly the dialogue) were rather unimpressive.</p>
