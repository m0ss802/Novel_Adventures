        <h3><em><strong>3 stars</strong></em></h3>
        <h4>A sapphic fantasy romance with a vampire and death psychic</h4>
        <p>I thought the story was soft and cute, with an interesting world and plot but little emphasis on serious tension and stakes. The story moves along fast enough for the reader not to get worried about the problems characters face. The plot is predictable, but also took on huge amounts of history and importance that doesn't work with the short and sweet story style. Has some cozy mystery vibes mixed with rom-com and of course YA paranormal.</p>
