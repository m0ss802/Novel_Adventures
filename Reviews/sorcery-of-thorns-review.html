        <h3><em><strong>5 stars</strong></em></h3>
        <p>The writing didn't take my breath away like <em>An Enchantment of Ravens</em>, but I loved everything else. I love the character development and the effectiveness of Elisabeth's relationships with Silas and Nathaniel growing. I love the worldbuilding, especially the comfort of the books and library. The plot was interesting and high stakes, but the ending was both full of loss and full of hope. I really wanted a second epilogue for more Nathaniel and Elisabeth though!</p>
